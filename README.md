# Numpy and Pandas

This repository contains my first attempts at using the Python **numpy** and **pandas** packages.

## Numpy
I've created some arrays and used the following numpy functions and features:
  * mean
  * median
  * percentile
  * min
  * max
  * two-dimensional arrays

I've used these to create a five-figure summary for an array.

Note that the contents of the arrays are made-up statistics.

## Pandas
See The **football_ratings** directory, which contains data from Premier League football tables, and uses this to determine the underlying ability of the teams.

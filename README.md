# Numpy

This repository contains my first attempts at using numpy. I've created some arrays and used the following numpy functions and features:
  * mean
  * median
  * percentile
  * min
  * max
  * two-dimensional arrays

I've used these to create a five-figure summary for an array.


Note that the contents of the arrays are made-up statistics.
